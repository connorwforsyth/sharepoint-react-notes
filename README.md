# SharePoint Framework with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS & shadcn

A comprehensive guide for building modern SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web parts using React functional components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn components.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Essential Reading**: Start with [Development Principles & Patterns](./docs/00-development-principles.md) - this explains the "why" behind all architectural decisions and serves as your primary guide.

1. **Install SPFx Tools**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/generator-sharepoint yo gulp-cli
   ```

2. **Create Project**

   ```bash
   yo @microsoft/sharepoint
   # Choose React, TypeScript, and your preferred settings
   ```

3. **Add Modern Stack**

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography react-router-dom clsx tailwind-merge
   npx shadcn@latest init
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   gulp serve
   ```

- ✅ **Theme Switching** - Toggle between modern and SharePoint native styling
- ✅ **Analytics Integration** - PostHog for usage tracking and insights

## 🧠 Why This Stack?

This technology combination is specifically chosen for SharePoint Framework because:

- **SharePoint-Native**: Works within SharePoint's constraints rather than fighting them
- **Performance-Focused**: Optimized for SharePoint's environment and limitations
- **Maintainable**: Clear patterns that scale with team size and application complexity
- **User-Friendly**: Provides modern UX while feeling native to SharePoint users
- **Future-Proof**: Built on stable, widely-adopted technologies

## 🚦 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- SharePoint Online tenant
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and SharePoint

## 📖 Learning Path

1. **Read the principles document** - Understand the reasoning behind architectural decisions
2. **Study the PnP samples analysis** - Learn from real-world SharePoint Framework code
3. **Set up your development environment** - Follow the project setup guide
4. **Build your first component** - Apply the functional patterns
5. **Integrate with SharePoint data** - Connect to SharePoint Lists
6. **Add routing and navigation** - Implement HashRouter for multiple pages
7. **Style with Tailwind and shadcn** - Create beautiful, accessible UIs
8. **Implement theme switching** - Support both modern and SharePoint native styling
9. **Add analytics tracking** - Monitor usage and user behavior

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Always start with the **Development Principles** document - it explains the "why" behind every decision
- Review the **PnP Samples Analysis** to understand how our approach improves upon existing patterns
- Use **HashRouter** instead of BrowserRouter - it's essential for SharePoint integration
- Leverage **SharePoint's security model** rather than building custom authentication
- Design for **SharePoint's constraints** (throttling, list limits, etc.) from the beginning
- Focus on **component composition** over large, complex components
- Use **theme switching** to maintain familiar development experience while delivering native SharePoint styling
- Consider **analytics from day one** to understand how users interact with your application

## 🔍 What Makes This Different?

Our approach evolves SharePoint Framework development beyond current PnP samples by providing:

- **Modern React Patterns** - Consistent functional components with hooks
- **Advanced TypeScript** - Strict typing with `type` definitions over `interface`
- **Sophisticated State Management** - React Query for caching and optimistic updates
- **Multi-Page Architecture** - HashRouter for complex applications
- **Modern Styling** - Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui integration
- **Flexible Theme System** - Toggle between development and SharePoint native styling
- **Privacy-First Analytics** - Enterprise-ready usage tracking with PostHog
- **Performance Optimization** - Built for SharePoint's specific constraints
