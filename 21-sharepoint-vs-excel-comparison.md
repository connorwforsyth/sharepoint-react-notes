# SharePoint Lists vs Excel Online: BCM Database Comparison

This document compares SharePoint Lists and Excel Online as database backends for your Ausgrid BCM system, considering your preferences for minimal, name-based architecture.

## Your Requirements Summary

### **Design Preferences:**
✅ **Minimal database structure** - as few columns and complexity as possible  
✅ **Name-based relationships** - avoid artificial business codes where possible  
✅ **Simple hierarchy** - parent capability name column vs complex Level IDs  
✅ **Many-to-many flexibility** - applications used by multiple capabilities  
✅ **Scale handling** - potentially 5,000+ capability-application relationships  

## Option 1: SharePoint Lists Approach

**Capabilities:**
```
Title                    | ParentCapabilityName | Level | Tier
Asset Management         |                     | 1     | Core

Power BI | Analytics | Microsoft | Active
SAP PM   | ERP       | SAP       | Active
MyWorld  | GIS       | Custom    | Active
```

**CapabilityApplications (Junction):**
```
Title                           | CapabilityName     | ApplicationName | UsageType
Asset Management - Power BI     | Asset Management   | Power BI        | Supporting
Asset Management - SAP PM       | Asset Management   | SAP PM          | Primary

```

### **SharePoint Pros**

✅ **Native SharePoint integration** - works seamlessly with SharePoint ecosystem  
✅ **Item-level permissions** - can restrict access to specific capabilities/applications  
✅ **SharePoint search** - capabilities and applications appear in search results  
✅ **Workflow integration** - can trigger SharePoint workflows on data changes  
✅ **REST API** - fast, direct queries from React components  
✅ **Familiar SharePoint UX** - users can edit lists directly if needed  
✅ **Backup included** - part of SharePoint backup/restore  
✅ **Relational integrity** - lookup fields provide some referential integrity  

### **SharePoint Cons**

❌ **5,000 item view threshold** - junction table could hit limits with heavy app reuse  
❌ **Complex permission model** - SharePoint permissions can be overwhelming  
❌ **Less flexible** - harder to bulk edit relationships  
❌ **Query complexity** - multiple API calls needed for complex joins  
❌ **Indexing required** - must carefully index columns to avoid threshold issues  
❌ **SharePoint quirks** - lookup field limitations, OData query restrictions  

### **Scale Analysis for SharePoint**

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 500 capabilities × 3 apps each = 1,500 junction records ✅
- 200 unique applications ✅
- Well under 5,000 threshold ✅

**Realistic Estimate:**  
- Power BI used by 80 capabilities
- Excel used by 100 capabilities  
- SAP PM used by 50 capabilities
- 20 other apps with 10-20 uses each
- **Total: 3,000-4,000 junction records** ⚠️ (Approaching limit)

**Pessimistic Estimate:**
- Office 365 apps used everywhere
- ERP systems across all business areas
- **Total: 8,000+ junction records** ❌ (Over threshold)

## Option 2: Excel Online Approach

✅ **Real-time collaboration** - multiple users can edit simultaneously  
✅ **Version history** - Excel Online tracks all changes  
✅ **Export friendly** - native Excel format, easy backup  
✅ **Cost effective** - included with existing Office 365  
✅ **Flexible structure** - can add columns without schema changes  
✅ **Advanced filtering** - Excel's native filtering and sorting  

### **Excel Online Cons**

❌ **Performance** - Microsoft Graph API slower than SharePoint REST  
❌ **No SharePoint integration** - doesn't appear in SharePoint search  
❌ **Limited permissions** - Excel permissions less granular than SharePoint  
❌ **Concurrent editing issues** - potential locking with many simultaneous users  
❌ **No workflows** - can't trigger SharePoint workflows on changes  
❌ **API complexity** - Graph API more complex than SharePoint REST  
❌ **Less structured** - easier to introduce data inconsistencies  
❌ **Cache management** - need to handle Excel Online caching in React  

### **Scale Analysis for Excel Online**

**Any Scale:**
- 10,000+ capability-application relationships ✅
- 1,000+ capabilities ✅  
- 500+ applications ✅
- No practical limits ✅

## Implementation Comparison

### **SharePoint Query Example**
```typescript
// Multiple API calls needed for relationships
async getCapabilitiesForApplication(applicationName: string) {
  // Call 1: Get junction records
  const junctions = await this.getListItems("CapabilityApplications", 
    ["*"], [], `ApplicationName eq '${applicationName}'`);
  
  // Call 2: Get capability details  
  const capabilityNames = junctions.map(j => j.CapabilityName);
  const capabilities = await this.getListItems("Capabilities",
    ["*"], [], capabilityNames.map(name => `Title eq '${name}'`).join(" or "));
    
  return { capabilities, junctions };
}
```

### **Excel Online Query Example**
```typescript
// Single API call gets all data
async getCapabilitiesForApplication(applicationName: string) {
  // Call 1: Get all sheets data at once
  const [junctionData, capabilityData] = await Promise.all([
    this.graphClient.get(`/workbook/worksheets/CapabilityApplications/usedRange`),
    this.graphClient.get(`/workbook/worksheets/Capabilities/usedRange`)
  ]);
  
  // Process in memory (faster than multiple API calls)
  const relationships = junctionData.values.filter(row => row[1] === applicationName);
  const capabilities = capabilityData.values.filter(row => 
    relationships.some(rel => rel[0] === row[0])
  );
  
  return { capabilities, relationships };
}
```

## Data Entry Comparison

### **SharePoint Data Entry**
```
User Experience:
1. Navigate to CapabilityApplications list
2. Click "New" 
3. Fill form fields with dropdowns
4. Save item
5. Repeat for each relationship

Pros: ✅ Validated, ✅ Structured
Cons: ❌ Slow, ❌ One-by-one entry
```

### **Excel Data Entry**
```
User Experience:
1. Open Excel Online
2. Navigate to CapabilityApplications sheet
3. Paste multiple rows at once
4. Use fill-down for bulk entry
5. Auto-save

Pros: ✅ Fast bulk entry, ✅ Copy/paste friendly
Cons: ❌ Less validation, ❌ Easier to make mistakes
```

## Performance Comparison

### **SharePoint Performance**
```
Query Time: 200-500ms per API call
Multiple calls needed: 3-5× slower for complex queries
Caching: SharePoint handles automatically
Concurrent users: Handles 100+ users well
```

### **Excel Performance**  
```
Query Time: 500-1500ms per Graph API call
Single calls possible: Faster for complex queries
Caching: Must implement manually
Concurrent users: 10-20 users before issues
```

## Recommendation Matrix

### **Choose SharePoint Lists If:**
✅ **Scale**: Under 3,000 capability-application relationships  
✅ **Integration**: Need SharePoint search, workflows, permissions  
✅ **Governance**: Need strict data validation and structure  
✅ **Users**: Technical users comfortable with SharePoint  
✅ **Performance**: Need fast query performance  

### **Choose Excel Online If:**
✅ **Scale**: Over 5,000 capability-application relationships expected  
✅ **Flexibility**: Need bulk editing and data manipulation  
✅ **Users**: Business users prefer Excel interface  
✅ **Data Entry**: Frequent bulk updates to relationships  
✅ **Cost**: Want to minimize additional licensing  

## Hybrid Option: Best of Both Worlds

### **Master Data in Excel + Cache in SharePoint**
```
Workflow:
1. Business users maintain relationships in Excel Online
2. Automated process syncs to SharePoint Lists hourly  
3. React components query SharePoint for performance
4. Complex bulk updates done in Excel
5. Real-time queries from SharePoint cache

Benefits:
✅ Excel flexibility for data entry
✅ SharePoint performance for queries  
✅ No 5,000 item limits (Excel is source of truth)
✅ SharePoint integration maintained
```

## Final Recommendation

**Based on your preferences for minimal, name-based architecture:**

### **For Current Scale (< 3,000 relationships): SharePoint Lists**
- Aligns with your minimal column approach
- Name-based relationships work well
- Integrates perfectly with SharePoint ecosystem
- Performance advantages for queries

### **For Future Scale (> 5,000 relationships): Excel Online**
- No artificial limits on growth
- Maintains your minimal architecture  
- Business users can manage relationships directly
- Power Query integration matches your workflow

### **Pragmatic Approach: Start with SharePoint, Plan for Excel**
1. **Implement SharePoint Lists first** using your minimal schema
2. **Monitor junction table growth** 
3. **Migrate to Excel Online** when approaching 4,000 relationships
4. **Same React components** can work with both backends

This approach lets you start simple and scale when needed, while maintaining your preferences for minimal, name-based database design throughout.
