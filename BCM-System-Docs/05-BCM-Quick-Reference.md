## System Overview

**What it does**: Manages relationships between business capabilities and software applications  
**Data storage**: Excel Online workbook (3 sheets)  
**User interface**: SharePoint web part  
**Maintenance**: Zero - it's self-managing  

## For Business Users (Data Managers)

### Making Changes

**To add a new capability**:
1. Open the Excel workbook
2. Go to "Capabilities" sheet  
3. Add new row with capability details
4. Save (auto-saves in Excel Online)

**To add application relationships**:
1. Go to "CapabilityApplications" sheet
2. Add row: CapabilityName | ApplicationName | UsageType
3. Save
4. Changes appear in web part within 1-2 minutes

**To bulk update relationships**:
1. Use Excel's copy/paste, fill-down, and filter features
2. Import from other spreadsheets 
3. Use Find & Replace for bulk changes

### Data Rules

‚úÖ **Capability names must match exactly** between sheets  
‚úÖ **Application names must match exactly** between sheets  
‚úÖ **Use consistent naming** (case-sensitive)  
‚úÖ **Keep it simple** - clear, full names work best  

‚ùå **Don't use special characters** in names  
‚ùå **Don't leave blank rows** in the middle of data  
‚ùå **Don't use abbreviations** unless necessary  

## For End Users (Web Part Users)

### Finding Information

**To see applications for a capability**:
1. Enter capability name in search box
2. Click "Find Applications"  
3. View table of supporting applications

**To understand relationships**:
- **Primary**: Core applications for this capability
- **Supporting**: Applications that help but aren't essential

### Tips

- **Use exact names** - search is case-sensitive
- **Try partial names** if you're unsure of the full name
- **Check with business users** if data seems outdated

## For Developers

### Key Files

**Excel workbook structure**:
```
Sheet 1: Capabilities (CapabilityName, ParentCapabilityName, Level, Tier, Definition, Owner)
Sheet 2: Applications (ApplicationName, Category, Vendor, Status)  
Sheet 3: CapabilityApplications (CapabilityName, ApplicationName, UsageType, Notes)
```

**Core service**:
```typescript
// Get workbook ID
const workbookId = "YOUR-EXCEL-FILE-ID";

// Read relationships
const response = await graphClient.get(
  `/me/drive/items/${workbookId}/workbook/worksheets/CapabilityApplications/usedRange`
);
```

### Adding Features

**Common extensions**:
- Search by application name (reverse lookup)
- Display capability hierarchy
- Show all data in filterable tables
- Export functionality

**Integration points**:
- Microsoft Graph API (built into SPFx)
- Excel Online (no setup required)
- SharePoint web parts (standard deployment)
