## What You're Building

A system where:
- **Business users** manage capabilities and applications in Excel
- **End users** explore relationships through a SharePoint web part
- **No maintenance** required once set up

## The Simple Architecture

**Excel Online** stores your data:
- **Capabilities sheet**: Your business capabilities
- **Applications sheet**: Your software applications  
- **Relationships sheet**: Which apps support which capabilities

**SharePoint web part** provides the interface:
- Search and explore capabilities
- See which applications support each capability
- Navigate capability hierarchies

## Why This Approach

‚úÖ **Zero maintenance** - Excel handles everything automatically  
‚úÖ **Unlimited scale** - no limits on relationships  
‚úÖ **Business user friendly** - everyone knows Excel  
‚úÖ **Bulk editing** - copy/paste hundreds of relationships  
‚úÖ **No complex setup** - uses existing Office 365 tools
